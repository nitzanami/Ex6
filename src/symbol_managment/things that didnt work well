//first 1 - string accepts boolean value, mb there are others of the same problem
// bool < int < double is ok, other things are not legit as far as I know.
String b;
b = false;

//2 - its working but 'a' isn't initiated (must not be used till initialisation)
void func(double x, boolean b){
    if(true){
        int a;
        x = a;
    }
    return;
}

//2.2 same if global:
int a;
void func(double x, boolean b){
    if(true){
        x = a;
    }
    return;
}

//3 - at line "if(p)", p is not known to memoryManager
void func(final double x, boolean b){
    int p = 3;
    if(p){
        int a;
    }
    return;
}

// thing for me to make sure:
when using parameter - that it was initialized (like in boolean, not to check only for its type)
