    ~~~ logic files ~~~
    main                - loads the program, runs LineProcessor on the file and reports the result
    Status              - Enum for the program status.(VALID, SYNTAX, IOERROR)
    LineProcessor       - iterate once to know the function names + params, init global variables.
                          iterate again to make sure that the s-java was written fine.
    FunctionManager     - The class that manages function calls. remember which functions are known
                          and what VarTypes each function accepts.
    MemoryManager       - Manages Scopes for variable declaration and uses.
    VarType             - an Enum for the legit types. currently: boolean,char,int,double,String
    DownCaster          - A single method class used to compare VarTypes,
                          with double accepts int, boolean accepts double and int.
    VariableAttributes  - Hold the information about a variable. (name, is it initialized, etc.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Design ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assuming iteration over the text only once:
    Issue 1: how would we know what function call is legit? maybe it's initialized later, maybe not?
    Issue 2: how would we know what variable is global? maybe it's declare later, maybe not?

Therefore we decided to iterate twice over the file. first to solve the issues mentioned above
then to check the validity of the rest of the code.
That's how FunctionManager and MemoryManager as solution to Issue 1 and 2, respectively,came to life

!FunctionManager! begged the question - how would we contain the knowledge of which function
receives which parameter type? that birthed the Enum !VarType!, and that with the ds:
Map<String functionName, List<VarType>>.
now given the function declaration "void foo(T x, Z y, P p){" we saved the pair (foo,[T,Z,P]) in the
 map, and given a function call "foo(x, y)" we compared the VarTypes sent to the function with those
  we saved in our in the map for the key "foo".

!MemoryManager! begged the question - how would we make a scope-like memory, and what would it hold?
That was solved easily using a List - at 0 index the global variables, and each '{' adds depth-scope
to the list. what would the list hold?
for that we made !VariableAttribute! that holds for a variable name(key in a given scope) more
information like, is final, is initialized, and more along with useful functionality


// to delete
o Design: in this section, you should document all design issues and decisions you have made (not
including those that were provided by us of course). You should briefly describe the design (what are
the classes, what are their relationships, etc.). When using inheritance, you should describe the
inheritance hierarchy. Finally, but most importantly, you should briefly explain why you have made
the various design choices, and which others you have considered.

o Implementation issues: this section should contain all important comments about implementation
issues that you think would help understand your code or should be pointed out since they are
important in some sense.

o Answers to questions: in this section, you will answer the questions you were asked to answer in the
README file.

o If an exercise explicitly states a change from this format, you should follow the guidelines within
the exercise!

● Source files: Each source file should be well documented according to the coding style guide.
